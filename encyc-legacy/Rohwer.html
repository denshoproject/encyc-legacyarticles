          The Rohwer site is located in southeastern Arkansas, in Desha County, twelve miles northeast of McGehee, 110 miles southeast of Little Rock, and just 27 miles from the Jerome camp. The heavily forested and swampy marshland was part of the Mississippi River flood plain—the river itself flowed five miles to the east—and the land had been purchased by the Farm Security Administration in the 1930s from tax delinquent landowners who had been unable to clear and drain it. Largely abandoned subsequently, the WRA acquired the 10,161 acre parcel in 1942. Supervised by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Linebarger-Senne Construction Company was contracted to build the camp at cost of $4.8 million.

          Due in part to the arduous labor required to clear and drain the site, the camp was late to open and was still largely unfinished when the first inmates began to arrive from the

Adkins supported unsuccessful legislation that would have barred Asian Americans—including American citizens—from owning land and successfully banned Japanese Americans from leaving camp for work in the state or from attending any of the colleges in the state.

          The main residential area of the camp consisted of about 500 acres (about one square mile) that were surrounded by barbed wire fences and eight guard towers. As with other camps, the inmates were housed in "apartments" that were partitioned sections of 20' by 120' barracks. The barracks were arranged in groups of twelve that were called "

          ," with each block housing between 250 and 300 individuals. Each of the 36 residential blocks had communal showers, toilets, and laundry facilities along with a mess hall. Camp wide institutions such as schools, hospitals, and administrative offices were located in barracks set aside for that purpose. External security—including manning the guard towers—was provided by the army's 334th Military Police Company; internal security was handled by WRA's police force, consisting of five white administrators and around 50 unarmed inmates.

          The WRA mostly assigned local bureaucrats to the top administrative positions at Jerome. Camp Director Ray D. Johnson was 44 year old native of Cushman, Arkansas, who had worked for the Farm Security Administration. His top deputies included James F. Rains as operations division head, Francis R. Mangham as chief of administrative management, and Joseph B. Hunter as head of community management. Hunter had spent six years as a missionary in Manchuria and Japan was the presumed "Japanese" expert on the staff. The project attorney was Jack Curtis and the reports officer was Austin Smith, Jr.

          Life was communal and regimented. Meals were taken in mess halls at designated times, disturbing traditional family units as children and adults alike soon took to eating with friends and peers rather than family. Privacy was scarce, both in the communal toilets that lacked dividers and in the barracks themselves where the partitions between "apartments" did not go all the way to the roof. Within each "apartment," families were issued a cot, mattress, and blankets which were illuminated by a single light bulb. Other furniture would have to be constructed by the inmates out of scrap lumber; as a result, scrap lumber—and even nails—became cherished items. (See

          Ever conscious of not being perceived as "coddling" the inmates, the WRA made sure that they spent less on inmate meals than the forty-five cents per person per day allotted for American soldiers, averaging thirty-seven cents for the inmates. Food rations were augmented by agricultural cultivation at the camp. Utilizing a special irrigation system that drew water from a nearby bayou, Rohwer produced 102 different agricultural products totaling over 1.2 million pounds in 1943 alone. Surplus vegetables from Rohwer were even shipped to nearby Camp Robinson and to the state veteran's hospital in Little Rock.

          One of the ways that inmates were able to augment their diets—as well as acquire other goods and services not provided by the authorities—was through the establishment of a co-op. Run by the inmates with the cooperation of the WRA, the co-op was a non-profit operation that ran camp dry goods stores, dry cleaning, beauty salons, movie screenings and much more, a total of twenty service departments. From an initial $250 investment, the Rohwer co-op grew to encompass nearly $100,000 in total assets by September 1944.

          As at other camps, a high percentage of the population was made up of school-age children, and K–12 schools and adult classes were instituted. Rohwer's schools didn't open until November 9, 1942, and even then, chairs did not appear for weeks and other supplies and equipment for months. Nonetheless, some 2,017 students attended Rohwer's schools, taught by 87 teachers. WRA efforts to hire white teachers from the local community ran into a roadblock when it was discovered that the federal wage scale—due in part to the year round schedule and the arduous conditions at the camp schools—was more than twice the average salary of Arkansas teachers, leading to charges the Arkansas' students would be shortchanged by teachers flocking to teach in the concentration camps. (Their salary was also more than seven times what inmate teachers received.) The WRA agreed to seek permission from a school before approaching teachers and to limiting itself to hiring two teachers from any one school district. Despite the high salaries, Rohwer still could not fill its quota of teachers.

The most popular of the camp's 32 softball teams drew crowds of up to 2,000, including inmates and WRA staff alike. Up to 5,000 spectators—more than half of the camp's population—attended engei-kai (variety shows) put on by the Issei Recreation Department, which toured different blocks in the camp over the course of several days.

The reaction to these dances by the women was mixed, with reports of rough treatment by some of the men on one hand and enjoyment of the skewed gender ratio and the amount of attention each woman received on the other. USO facilities were also set up at Jerome and Rohwer for visiting Nisei troops.

          As at other camps, a large percentage of the adult population took on jobs with the WRA helping the camp to operate, whether as mess hall workers, hospital workers, teachers, and the like, on the artificially low WRA wage scale ($12/$16/$19 per month) designed to insure that inmates would never be paid more than soldiers, but creating large inequalities between inmate and white workers doing the same work. As at Jerome, many Rohwer inmates were dispatched into the surrounding forest to cut wood to heat the camp, work that was particularly dangerous and arduous. Tragedy struck on January 19, 1943, when a falling tree killed inmate Seizo Imada.

          The danger went beyond falling trees. On November 17, 1942, three inmates working in the woods outside the camp were fired at by a local deer hunter who claimed that he thought the men were trying to escape—this despite the presence of a Caucasian supervisor. Two of men were wounded by the buckshot. Hoping to avoid stirring up racial tensions, the WRA pushed to avoid vigorous prosecution, and the shooter ended up not doing any jail time and paying only a small fine. Earlier that month, a guard for a construction company at Rohwer wounded three inmate boys with birdshot when he claimed they were throwing rocks at him.
