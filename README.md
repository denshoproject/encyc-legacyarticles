# encyc-legacyarticles

In 2020, several articles in the Densho Encyclopedia were replaced with newer versions; however, there was a need to continue making the original articles accessible. 
In order to support this, static versions of the legacy articles were created. The `/content/` directory in this repo contains both the html files and the supporting images. The `getlegacyimgs.py` script is used to retrieve the thumbnail images from the production site cache.
